                    <h3>Introduction to SAMR</h3>
                    <p>SAMR is a framework developed by Dr. Ruben Puentedura that assists teachers to effectively use technology in their classrooms. SAMR presets a hierarchical scale beginning at the substitution level and transitioning to the redefinition level. To familiarize yourself with this framework and definitions, you can <a href="https://www.educatorstechnology.com/2023/05/samr-model-visually-explained-for-2.html">read this excellent post</a> by Med Karbach in Educators Technology. In a nutshell, SAMR promotes teachers to pay attention to what technology brings to their student’s learning experience and then progressively focus on using technology to redefine and transform learning activities.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Going all the way back to when I was a student in secondary school, I was interested in big ideas, big questions, and progress. Naturally, I was drawn to technology because of its ability to change and improve my life and the lives of those around me. In the same spirit, this article will be focused on how we can use technology in the classroom to redefine educational experiences and elevate those experiences to a higher level than traditional learning experiences.</p>

                    <h3>What does redefinition look like?</h3>
                    <p>I believe that it is hard to know what to aim at as an end goal if we do not know what is possible. To make matter worse, this end goal is a moving target. Technology is constantly in development, and a shiny, new, promising technology released every week. So, what does tomorrow’s redefined student experience look like?</p>
                    <p>In 2016 Kathy Shrock wrote that “the most logical overview of the redefinition level…has to do with students choosing tasks and tools to show what they’ve learned.” Student choice is very important to keep students engaged, and allowing students to express their learning by the means they decide is necessary, creates a sense of ownership, pride, and is inclusive to the diverse strengths of students. Shrock goes on to say that there are many applications and online tools available that allow students to communicate and collaborate in real-time and to produce products for an outside audience. These redefined and enriched learning experiences were never possible before technology enabled them.</p>
                    <p>In the SAMR framework, a key component of redefinition is global collaboration. Technology has enabled students to communicate beyond their physical borders. This enables students to gain new insights and perspectives while participating in a global learning effort.</p>

                    <h3>Examples of redefined learning experiences</h3>
                    <p>Here are some ideas for ways that teachers can redefine learning experiences to create rich assessment tasks for students:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Global collaboration and creation projects</li>
                        <li>Biofeedback-driven research and learning</li>
                        <li>Virtual reality experiences in the past and present</li>
                        <li>Student-created documentaries and articles</li>
                        <li>Interactive labs and simulations</li>
                        <li>Programming new applications and programs</li>
                        <li>AI-powered creative projects</li>
                        <li>Collaborative mind mapping</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>How about when redefinition gets redefined?</h3>
                    <p>Where do we go from here? That is the question that I have ended up asking myself. Once redefined learning experiences become the norm, how to those experiences become redefined? I believe that the answer will always be found in helping students develop the skills to innovate and create. Like Bloom’s Taxonomy, the SAMR framework is gradual. As we gradually redefine and improve learning experiences, students' competency levels should also rise to the ability to create. As teachers, our goal should be empowering students to be creative, innovative, and capable of changing the world around them. With the right mindset and by putting technology to its highest and best use, we can enable students to be the creators of a brighter future.</p>
